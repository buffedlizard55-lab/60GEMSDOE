- **HOLDOUT-DTI, inherited H65-1:** 0.01158, 95% CI [0.00840, 0.01462],
  22,641 withheld positives, evaluator `gems57-pooled-hide-v2`. Not rerun or a leaderboard score.
- **Uniqueness:** historical scan is incomplete; raw 3-pixel overlap fails the literal 70% rule.
  Byte uniqueness is insufficient. Dense/lattice rasters receive no exception.
- **Format:** the downloaded H65-1 file passes a fresh shared-validator check: single band,
  float32, all finite in [0,1], matching sample CRS/shape/transform. Local validity is not organizer acceptance.
- **Score evidence:** 0.2778 remains owner-reported/unverified for H33; no organizer receipt ties it to exact bytes.
  Conflicting leaderboard figures in the brief are not current verified ranks.
- **Decision:** negative. Zero new experiments and zero submission slots used in this review.

Historical comparator `dotted-h19-5-d2-8-20261002-e56ea318af89-nan` remains in the audit trail, not a recommended upload.

## What this review fixes

The old front page simultaneously said STOP and PROMOTE. H66/H67's published promotion
also excluded dense registry rasters despite the literal uniqueness requirement.
The current renderer now suppresses historical promotion banners while stopped, the affected
run cards carry a negative erratum, and the legacy selector cannot waive overlap using a random null.
The shared stop guard also rejects absent or non-affirmative first-test evidence.
Historical measurements are retained; no score is invented to justify a submission.

## Reproduce the three-pass review

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python scripts/review_submission_status.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_site.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
```

The format audit reads existing TIFFs; it does not generate predictions or upload anything.
[Four ranked, deferred geological hypotheses](docs/research/next-chi-hypotheses-2026-10-11.md)
include layers, mechanisms, catalogue-generalization rationale, mimics, costs and data gaps.
They are **not cleared for execution** under the lane STOP. Full registry availability,
official lithology/hydroclimate coverage, and organizer receipts remain unresolved.

Parallel review retained: [H68 audit](docs/research/2026-10-11-lane-stop-audit.md) and [H68 historical review card](docs/h68-runcard.json). Both agree that no lane submission is cleared.

Inherited brief retained below. It is an abridged transcription, not a verbatim copy: earlier sessions condensed the site ledger and inserted errata. The current user request and its literal STOP rules take precedence.

<details open><summary><b>The prompt this project runs on</b></summary>

```text
Review the repo.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE HIGHEST URGENCY AND MUST BE FOLLOWED!

MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION.  DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION.  BUT WE MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION.  IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS OK TO DOWNLOAD AND SUBMIT THE GENERATED TIF SUBMISSION.

There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt.  Read the entire prompt.

Tectonic-geomorphology lane: channel steepness and knickpoints, not scarp shape. Kirby and Whipple (2012) review how bedrock-channel steepness and knickpoints record spatial gradients in rock uplift, including across active normal faults. Perron and Royden's χ transform (ESPL, 2013) puts different channels on a comparable footing, and Gailleton et al. (Earth Surface Dynamics) give a reproducible knickpoint-segmentation method. Scarps degrade and bury, but channel profiles keep recording base-level steps, so this can see faults the curvature features no longer show. Extract drainage from the free 3DEP 10 m DEM (or 1 m tiles), compute χ and normalized steepness, and keep only knickpoints and steepness steps that align across several independent drainages along a common strike. First test: do channels crossing withheld segments show larger steepness steps than random lines of the same orientation? If not, stop. Map and mask the usual confounds: lithology, climate gradients, ephemeral channels and playa base levels. Output the standard validated GeoTIFF, uniqueness-checked against every earlier raster.

PARALLEL-RUN PROTOCOL — read first. This session is one of several running from this same prompt.

1. LANE. Your lane is the single method paragraph below. Stay inside it. If your raster's rank-correlation with any registry raster exceeds [0.90], or more than [70%] of your dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots, you have drifted into another lane: log it as a duplicate and stop. Check this on the surface before placement AND on the final dots.

2. REUSE, DON'T REBUILD. Use the template's cached feature stack, evaluate_holdout.py and submission_writer.py. Holdout = hide-and-recover: withhold whole fault segments with a buffer, derive every catalogue-based feature only from the visible faults, mask visible faults pixel-exactly, score pooled DTI (alpha 0.2, beta 0.8, 300 m triangular kernel). If a shared tool is wrong, fix it once in the template and report it; never keep a private fork.

3. LABEL EVERY NUMBER as HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator version, number of withheld positives, 95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (copied from a submission-page receipt). A projection is never written as a score.

4. LEAKAGE CANARY. Test each feature alone on the holdout before trusting any result. AUC above [0.90] means leakage until proven otherwise.

5. RUN CARD. End with one JSON card: hypothesis; mechanism; the named non-fault process that could mimic it; holdout DTI + CI; correlation/overlap vs registry; raster sha256; validator output (no NaN inside the footprint, values in [0,1], CRS/shape/transform match); submission name + note of at most 140 characters; verdict promote / negative. Negative results are deliverables.

6. BUDGET. Stop after [3] experiments or [2] hours. Do not pick submissions: promotion to a real slot is a separate selector step, within the weekly cap shown on the submission page.

The following sites should serve as a starting point for understanding how to generate TIF submissions.  These websites are researched, and tested and have generated TIF submissions.  But we need to generate high scoring submissions.

Here are the results from submissions into the competition, separated by ....:

WE NEED TO STUDY, ANALYZE, AND UNDERSTAND THE HIGHEST SCORE FROM THE GEMDOE SITE WHERE THE SUBMISSION TIF IS DOWNLOADED FROM WHICH IS THE FOLLOWING:

[https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE32/docs/index.html](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE32/docs/index.html)

h33-h33-2-b2-20261004T220000Z-e5eb6e7e-zeros: 0.2778

Why and how did this get the highest score and are we able to generate a submission that scores higher than 0.2778?

Answer the question using Phd level experience, knowledge, and judgement. Then use the answer to generate a unique TIF submission into the competition.  Must be unique submission unlike any within the GEMSDOE sites above.  Verify working line by line no hallucinations.

Historical repository-page leaderboard figure (not current official board):

0.3774	[https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE/docs/index.html](https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE/docs/index.html)

**Dated erratum (2026-10-11):** this 0.3774 value is a historical repository-page figure, not the current official public leaderboard. The manual official-page read is #1 xiaofanhu 0.4133; DARD 0.3195 is rank 8. See [`registry/leaderboard_snapshot_2026-10-11.json`](registry/leaderboard_snapshot_2026-10-11.json).

[The full per-repository score ledger (GEMSDOE … 62GEMSDOE), dated public-board rows, and provenance distinctions are maintained in `docs/score-ledger.csv`; the official leaderboard link https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/306/competition-doe-gems/leaderboard/, and the resource links: https://github.com/drivendataorg/gems-prize-reference-solution ; https://www.usgs.gov/data/geodawn-airborne-magnetic-and-radiometric-surveys-northwestern-great-basin-nevada-and ; https://gbcge.org/current-projects/ingenious/ ; https://epsg.io/32611 ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tversky_index ]

We need to quickly look at the results and results from the GEMSDOE websites above.

Before implementing, generate 3–5 candidate geological hypotheses we haven't tried yet, each naming: the specific layer(s) involved, the physical signature being targeted (e.g., an edge-detection or curvature transform), why it should catch a fault missing from the USGS/INGENIOUS catalogue rather than one already in it, and how it differs from anything already implemented in this repo. Rank them by expected DTI improvement and implementation cost. Validate the top candidate on our spatially-blocked holdout set before touching a weekly submission slot — do not spend a submission slot on an idea that hasn't beaten the current holdout best. If a candidate can't be validated without new external data, name the specific free, official source needed and check it's obtainable before proposing the idea as viable.

Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.

We have a good understanding of how our hypothesis, methodology, calculations, analysis are done so we should be able to figure out a way to score higher on the leaderboard using previous results and scoring that we have across the sites listed above.  We need to come up with distinct and unique strategies to score higher in this competition leaderboard.  We need to start doing heavy and deep research into the part of the project that matters the most, which is the scientific discovery of geothermal vents.  We should store all of our information and knowledge that we can gather from official verified sources.  This will serve as a starting point for other projects as well.  We need to think outside the box but still be grounded in proper scientific research, we are ultimately aiming for a top prize that many others are competing for.  So it's important to be contrarian but be smart about it.  We need to find sources of data that others are over looking or areas of the project when it comes to geothermal vents.  We need to do deep research and critical thinking and come up with new hypothesis to test.

0.3195	is the highest score right now so we need to design a new strategy, research, testing, analyzing, and generating submission system than the current website.  It should be unique, take unique approaches to generating a submission that can score higher than 0.3195.

**Dated erratum (2026-10-11):** the preceding 0.3195 statement is historical. The current manually read public leader is 0.4133 (xiaofanhu); 0.3195 (DARD) is rank 8. Public rows are not project scores or file attribution.

Put this prompt into the repo readme and read it everytime we work on the project as a starting point to make sure we are building what we are aiming for and have a strong base to continue building and improving on making something useful for everyday use.  It should solve the problem of having to manually check everything ourselves and having an up to date current feed.

Review the repo.

The following is taken from the Arena AI team and I think it makes a good point on building a successful project, so let's keep the Core Values and Own the Outcome as a focal point when building, developing, researching, suggesting upgrades, and implementing the work.

Our Core Values

Maximize P(Win)

“Maximize the Probability of Winning”: our decision making framework. In every decision, we weigh tradeoffs, assess risk, and choose the path that maximizes the probability that Arena succeeds. We set aside our emotions and make tough decisions in order to maximize P(Win). “Maximize P(Win)” frees us from constraints and clarifies that we must put Arena first.

Own the Outcome

We own results end to end — not just our individual slice of the work. When problems arise and we have the means to act, we do so without waiting for permission or assignment. We treat failure and success as signals and use them to improve. At Arena, we stay accountable to the final outcome.

We need to focus on being able to generate a submission into the competition.

The site should be able to generate a TIF file that is required for submission.  It should be as easy as download to click a File to submit into the competition.  This needs to be in the executive summary or the very beginning of the site.  it should be obvious when you visit the site.

I tried to submit the document that i downloaded from the site but it returned this error on the submission form:

"Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"

Also we need to give it a unique name and A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Here is the submission page when i click submit file

New submission

File to submit / No file chosen

You can submit a single-band GeoTIFF (.tif) file, or a .zip file containing a single GeoTIFF, with your predictions. It must match the submission format's CRS, shape, and geotransform. You may wish to review the competition rules first.

Note (optional)

A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25

Create a executive summary subpage that explains exactly how to make a submission into the contest.

Work on the next steps from the previous sessions first.

The goal of this project is to place top of the leaderboard in this competition.  The following is the competition:
